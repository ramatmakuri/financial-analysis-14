# # Machine Learning Trading Bot

In this assignment, financial Python programming skills will be used with machine learning to imporve algorithmic trading systems. For this purpose, I will improve an exisiting algorithmic trading systems with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data. 

Data source: CSV file

Packages Used This project leverages python 3.7

Installation Guide: The application requires the below programs to be installed

Python
Pandas
Numpy
SKlearn

The steps followed and the results are provided below: 

1. Establish a Baseline Performance using SVC Classifier tool
    Results:
    
        
2. Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm uisng by tuning or adjusting, the modelâ€™s input features for SVC Classifier. Input festures adjusted include: a. adjusting the size of the training dataset; b.Adjusting the windows for the algorithm
    Results:
        
    
3. Evaluate with New Machine Learning Classifiers - `AdaBoost`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, or `LogisticRegression
    Results:
    
Evaluation Report

In the previous sections, you updated your `README.md` file with your conclusions. To accomplish this section, you need to add a summary evaluation report at the end of the `README.md` file. For this report, express your final conclusions and analysis. Support your findings by using the PNG images that you created.
